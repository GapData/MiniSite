# Keep-Current - Mini-site

## What is Keep-Current

The Keep-Current project's target is to assist with the problem of finding and retreiving news.

This repository includes a landing page (mini-site) that elaborates about the project and calls users to submit initial data.
The initial landing-page is located under the landing-page folder, and a runnign website can be found [here](http://keep-current.netlify.com/).

For more information about Keep-Current project, please refer to [the main repository](https://github.com/liadmagen/Keep-Current/).
In addition, the main site app can be found in our [Keep-Current-App](https://github.com/liadmagen/Keep-Current-App) reporitory.

## How you can help

We welcome anyone who would like to join and contribute! We meet regularly every month in Vienna through the Data Science Cafe meetup of the VDSG, show our progress and discuss the next steps.

If you would like to assist, we would like to encourage you to:

* Try it out and report us issues
* Read our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Dive into our Project [Backlog](https://github.com/liadmagen/Keep-Current-Site/projects)

If you wish to assist in different aspects (Data Engineering / Data Science / DevOps), we have divided the project to several additional repositories focusing on these topics. Feel free to check them out!
